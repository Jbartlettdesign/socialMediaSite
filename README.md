This project is a new social media website focused around giving a pleasant user experience.
This application uses a Node and Express back end and uses both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
It follows a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the template engine.
It is also backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM and protects API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
